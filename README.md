## Building a secure communication layer for Multi-Party Comptuing - Project Description

## 1. Visions and Goals of the Project

Our communication layer will replace Message Passing Interface (MPI), the data transfer protocol currently being used by Secrecy to perform Multi-Party Computing (MPC). High-level goals for this project include:

  - Get rid of the MPI layer in Secrecy and establish standing TCP connections
  - Implement asynchronous communication
  - Run Secrecy with our solution implemented on a Linux Unikernel
